              absolute threshold corresponded to 12-15 isomerized pigment

              enhances the encoding of specific features on different sides of
              natural borders in the visual field (for example, [1-3]). In
              central visual areas, one prominent natural border is formed by
              the confluence of information from the two eyes, the
              monocular-binocular border [4]. Here, we investigate whether
              receptive field properties of neurons in the mouse superior
              colliculus show any systematic organization about the
              monocular-binocular border. The superior colliculus is a layered
              midbrain structure that plays a significant role in the orienting
              responses of the eye, head, and body [5]. Its superficial layers
              receive direct input from the majority of retinal ganglion cells
              and are retinotopically organized [6, 7]. Using two-photon
              calcium imaging, we recorded the activity of collicular neurons
              from the superficial layers of awake mice and determined their
              direction selectivity, orientation selectivity, and retinotopic
              location. This revealed that nearby direction-selective neurons

              retinotopic space, the local preference of direction-selective
              neurons shows a sharp transition in the preference for nasal
              versus temporal motion at the monocular-binocular border. The
              maps representing orientation and direction appear to be
              independent. These results illustrate the important coherence

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The ability of the muscarinic cholinergic
              antagonist atropine to inhibit myopia development in humans and
              animal models would suggest that cholinergic hyperactivity may
              underlie myopic growth. To test this, we investigated whether
              cholinergic agonists accelerate ocular growth rates in chickens.
              Furthermore, we investigated whether atropine alters ocular
              growth by downstream modulation of dopamine levels, a mechanism
              postulated to underlie its antimyopic effects. EXPERIMENTAL
              APPROACH: Muscarinic (muscarine and pilocarpine), nicotinic
              (nicotine) and non-specific (oxotremorine and carbachol)
              cholinergic agonists were administered to chicks developing
              form-deprivation myopia (FDM) or chicks that were otherwise
              untreated. Vitreal levels of dopamine and its primary metabolite
              3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) were examined using mass
              spectrometry MS in form-deprived chicks treated with atropine
              (360, 15 or 0.15 nmol). Further, we investigated whether dopamine
              antagonists block atropine's antimyopic effects. KEY RESULTS:
              Unexpectedly, administration of each cholinergic agonist
              inhibited FDM but did not affect normal ocular development.
              Atropine only affected dopamine and DOPAC levels at its highest
              dose. Dopamine antagonists did not alter the antimyopia effects
              of atropine. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Muscarinic, nicotinic
              and non-specific cholinergic agonists inhibited FDM development.
              This indicates that cholinergic hyperactivity does not underlie
              myopic growth and questions whether atropine inhibits myopia via
              cholinergic antagonism. This study also demonstrates that changes
              in retinal dopamine release are not required for atropine's
              antimyopic effects. Finally, nicotinic agonists may represent a
              novel and more targeted approach for the cholinergic control of
              myopia as they are unlikely to cause the anterior segment side
              effects associated with muscarinic treatment.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: While low-dose atropine eye drops are currently widely
              used to inhibit myopia development in children, the underlying
              mechanisms are poorly understood. Therefore, we studied possible
              retinal mechanisms and receptors that are potentially involved in
              myopia inhibition by atropine. METHODS: A total of 250 $\mu$g
              atropine were intravitreally injected into one eye of 19
              chickens, while the fellow eyes received saline and served as
              controls. After 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 4 h, eyes were prepared
              for vitreal dopamine (DA) measurements, using high-pressure
              liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Twenty-four
              animals were kept either in bright light (8500 lx) or standard
              light (500 lx) after atropine injection for 1.5 h before DA was
              measured. In 10 chickens, the $\alpha$2A-adrenoreceptor
              ($\alpha$2A-ADR) agonists brimonidine and clonidine were
              intravitreally injected into one eye, the fellow eye served as
              control, and vitreal DA content was measured after 1.5 h. In 6
              chickens, immunohistochemical analyses were performed 1.5 h after
              atropine injection. RESULTS: Vitreal DA levels increased after a
              single intravitreal atropine injection, with a peak difference
              between both eyes after 1.97 h. DA was also enhanced in fellow
              eyes, suggesting a systemic action of intravitreally administered
              atropine. Bright light and atropine (which both inhibit myopia)
              had additive effects on DA release. Quantitative immunolabelling
              showed that atropine heavily stimulated retinal activity markers
              ZENK and c-Fos in cells of the inner nuclear layer. Since
              atropine was recently found to also bind to $\alpha$2A-ADRs at
              doses where it can inhibit myopia, their retinal localization was
              studied. In amacrine cells, $\alpha$2A-ADRs were colocalized with
              tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), glucagon, and nitric oxide synthase,
              peptides known to play a role in myopia development in chickens.
              Intravitreal atropine injection reduced the number of neurons
              that were double-labelled for TH and $\alpha$2A-ADR.
              $\alpha$2A-ADR agonists clonidine and brimonidine (which were
              also found by other authors to inhibit myopia) severely reduced
              vitreal DA content in both injected and fellow eyes, compared to
              eyes of untreated chicks. CONCLUSIONS: Merging our results with
              published data, it can be concluded that both muscarinic and
              $\alpha$2A-adrenergic receptors are expressed on dopaminergic
              neurons and both atropine and $\alpha$2A-ADR antagonists
              stimulate DA release whereas $\alpha$2A-ADR agonists strongly
              suppress its release. Stimulation of DA by atropine was enhanced
              by bright light. Results are in line with the hypothesis that

               in natural contexts. To determine how mice target their gaze
               during natural behavior, we measured head and bilateral eye
               movements in mice performing prey capture, an ethological
               behavior that engages vision. We found that the majority of eye
               movements are compensatory for head movements, thereby serving
               to stabilize the visual scene. During movement, however, periods
               of stabilization are interspersed with non-compensatory saccades
               that abruptly shift gaze position. Notably, these saccades do
               not preferentially target the prey location. Rather, orienting
               movements are driven by the head, with the eyes following in
               coordination to sequentially stabilize and recenter the gaze.
               These findings relate eye movements in the mouse to other
               species, and provide a foundation for studying active vision
               during ethological behaviors in the mouse.",

              artificial light pollution and other factors. We investigated
              this in the following manner. First we measured the spectral
              irradiance (from 300 to 700 nm) during the day, sunset, twilight,
              full moon, new moon, and in the presence of high levels of light

              chromaticities and to relative quantum catches for the nocturnal
              hawkmoth Deilephila elpenor, which has color vision. The

              in animal behavior.1, 2, 3, 4 Surprisingly, however,
              comparatively little is understood about color processing in the
              brain, including in widely used laboratory mammals such as mice.
              The retinal gradient in S- and M-cone opsin (co-)expression has
              traditionally been considered an impediment to mouse color
              vision.5, 6, 7, 8 However, recent data indicate that mice exhibit
              robust chromatic discrimination within the central-upper visual
              field.9 Retinal color opponency has been reported to emerge from
              superimposing inhibitory surround receptive fields on the cone
              opsin expression gradient, and by introducing opponent rod
              signals in retinal regions with sparse M-cone opsin
              expression.10, 11, 12, 13 The relative importance of these
              proposed mechanisms in determining the properties of neurons at
              higher visual processing stages remains unknown. We address these
              questions using multielectrode recordings from the lateral
              geniculate nucleus (LGN) in mice with altered M-cone spectral
              sensitivity (Opn1mwR) and multispectral stimuli that allow
              selective modulation of signaling by individual opsin classes.
              Remarkably, we find many (∼25\%) LGN cells are color opponent,
              that such cells are localized to a distinct medial LGN zone and
              that their properties cannot simply be explained by the proposed
              retinal opponent mechanisms. Opponent responses in LGN can be
              driven solely by cones, independent of cone-opsin expression
              gradients and rod input, with many cells exhibiting spatially
              congruent antagonistic receptive fields. Our data therefore
              suggest previously unidentified mechanisms may support extensive

              gain control over the pupillary response by decoupling pupil size
              changes from accommodation and vergence in the near triad: Even
              at maximal accommodation, the case voluntarily constricted his

              early processing stages, is modulated according to the internal
              state of the animal. Internal states, such as arousal, are often
              characterized by relating neural variables to a single ``level''
              of arousal, defined using a behavioral variable such as
              locomotion or pupil size. Here, we extend the notion of
              arousal-related modulation by showing that multifaceted aspects
              of pupil size dynamics can predict changes in neural activity.
              Specifically, we show that the phases of pupil size fluctuations
              occurring over multiple timescales modulate firing mode in the
              dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of mice. Increased
              firing rates, driven by a preponderance of tonic spiking,
              occurred during pupil dilations, while burst spikes
              preferentially occurred during contractions. We further find that
              these activity modulations could not be explained solely by pupil
              size per se , or by transitions between overt locomotion and
              quiescence, and extend to periods of patterned stimulus viewing.
              We conclude that dLGN spiking activity is modulated by
              pupil-indexed arousal processes on various timescales, with
              implications for the determination of arousal-related cortical

              selectively stimulate rods or cones in the Opn1lwLIAIS (LIAIS)
              mouse, in which the native M-cone pigment is replaced by a human
              L-cone pigment (L*). Methods: ERG recordings were performed on
              anesthetized LIAIS mice. ERG stimuli were sinusoidally modulated.
              After 10 minutes of adaptation to 0.4 candela per square meter
              (cd/m2) ERGs were measured, followed by 11-minute adaptation to
              8.8 cd/m2 background and recordings directly after the luminance
              increase and every second minute. Finally, during adaptation to
              0.4 cd/m2 for 32 minutes, ERG responses were recorded directly
              after the change in background and every second minute. This
              protocol was repeated with rod-isolating stimuli (8 Hz; 75\% rod

              and white light (8 Hz and 12 Hz; 100\% Michelson contrast).
              Results: At 8.8 cd/m2, responses directly displayed photopic
              response properties without further changes in either cone or
              white light responses. Rod-driven responses were very small.
              After the return to 0.4 cd/m2, both rod-driven and white light
              responses increased over a time course of about 30 minutes.

              photoreceptors in vivo has not been established with certainty.
              To investigate the response shape we compare the predictions of a
              recent model of transduction in primate cone photoreceptors with
              measurements extracted from human cones using the paired-flash
              electroretinogram method. As a check, we also compare the
              predictions with previous single-cell measurements of ground
              squirrel cone responses. RESULTS: The predictions of the model
              provide a good description of the measurements, using values of
              parameters within the range previously determined for primate
              retina. The dim-flash response peaks in about 20 ms, and flash
              responses at all intensities are essentially monophasic. Three
              time constants in the model are extremely short: the two time
              constants for inactivation (of visual pigment and of
              transducin/phosphodiesterase) are around 3 and 10 ms, and the
              time constant for calcium equilibration lies in the same range.
              CONCLUSION: The close correspondence between experiment and
              theory, using parameters previously derived for recordings from
              macaque retina, supports the notion that the electroretinogram
              approach and the modelling approach both provide an accurate
              estimate of the cone photoresponse in the living human eye. For

              investigating the circuitry that underlies complex ethologically
              relevant visual behaviors in the mouse have been primarily
              restricted to fear responses [3-5]. Here, we show that a

              is necessary for mice to perform the accurate orienting and

              differentially perturbed visual or auditory input in mice and

              allowing maintenance of bearing to within 11° of the target on

              pupillometer (n = 14), ERGs were recorded simultaneously from
              both eyes (n = 23) and IOP was measured with a modified Goldmann

              confirmed the consensual PLR did not have significantly different

              direct PLR. However, PLR velocity (p = 0.004) was significantly
              smaller in the consensual PLR. Electroretinography revealed
              a-wave amplitude of 168.3 +/- 9.6 microV with latency of 27.5 +/-

              mice on steady retinal illumination. METHODS: Anesthetized
              C57BL/6 mice aged 7 to 8 weeks were placed in a ganzfeld chamber
              in darkness, and in monochromatic (510 nm) and white light whose
              intensity was varied more than 6 log units. The pupils of the
              mice were photographed with an infrared video camera and recorded
              on videotape and the pupil areas determined by digital image
              analysis of the video recordings. RESULTS: Fully dark-adapted
              murine pupils had an area of 2.29 +/- 0.35 mm2. The minimum pupil
              size at saturating intensity was 0.10 +/- 0.05 mm2. The steady
              state pupil area declined to half its dark-adapted maximum when
              ganzfeld luminance was 10(-5) scotopic candela (scot. cd) per
              meter squared. Pupil area declined to 20\% of the dark-adapted
              magnitude at approximately 10(-3) scot. cd/m2. CONCLUSIONS: The
              mouse pupil can regulate retinal illumination by a factor
              exceeding 20. The neural circuitry that determines steady state
              murine pupil size is extremely sensitive to retinal illumination
              and under these experimental conditions is controlled almost
              exclusively by rod signals. This follows, because the ganzfeld
              illuminance (10(-5) scot. cd/m2) that causes the pupil to
              constrict to half its dark-adapted value corresponds to only
              approximately 0.01 photoisomerization per rod per second, whereas
              80\% reduction in pupil area occurs at approximately 1
              photoisomerization per rod per sec. Based on this extreme
              responsiveness to steady illumination, the hypothesis is proposed
              that the murine pupil functions to protect a retinal circuit that
              can become saturated at extremely low photon capture rates.
              General principles of dark-adapted retinal circuitry support the
              identification of the first three neurons in the circuit as the
              rod, the rod bipolar, and the AII-amacrine. The rod and rod
              bipolar neurons do not approach saturation at the intensities at
              which the pupil constricts, however, and it seems unlikely that
              the AII-amacrine does. Thus the retinal neurons protected from
              saturation by the mouse pupil constrictions are probably ganglion
              cells with large receptive fields that have sustained responses.",

              given stimulus to increase locus coeruleus discharge activity
              appears independent of affective valence (appetitive vs.
              aversive). Combined, these observations suggest that the locus
              coeruleus-noradrenergic system is a critical component of the
              neural architecture supporting interaction with, and navigation
              through, a complex world. These observations further suggest that
              dysregulation of locus coeruleus-noradrenergic neurotransmission

              disorders, as well as certain affective disorders, including

  abstract = "1. This paper describes the behaviour of the receptive field
              surround, and how surround signals combine with those from the
              centre to generate the discharge of the retinal ganglion cells of
              the cat. 2. A small test spot is flashed upon the middle of the
              receptive field of an on-centre X-cell, alone, or together with a
              concentric annulus of fixed luminance. The reduction in discharge
              brought about by the annulus is independent of spot luminance.
              From this it is inferred that centre and surround signals combine
              additively. 3. Knowing that the combination of signals is
              additive, the surround signal can be estimated by comparing the
              ganglion cell's response to diffuse illumination of its receptive
              field with that to an equiluminous spot which optimally
              stimulates the centre while encroaching minimally upon the
              periphery. 4. Application of this technique to X-cells shows that
              although the surround seems to have a threshold, it is at its
              most sensitive in the dark-adapted eye, and typically is only
              0.3-0.5 log units less sensitive than the centre. 5. Centre and
              surround sensitivities are decreased from their dark-adapted
              levels by increasing background illumination, but the decline of
              surround sensitivity is initially less rapid than that of the
              centre. Thus with increasing light-adaptation the surround
              becomes relatively more sensitive. In the light-adapted eye
              centre and surround are about equally sensitive to diffuse
              illumination. 6. Although, in the dark-adapted eye, illumination
              of the receptive field periphery of an on-centre unit depresses
              firing, removal of that illumination produces no off-discharge.
              Off-discharges appear only when background illumination exceeds
              about 104 quanta (507)/deg 2 sec. This confirms Barlow \& Levick
              (1969b). 7. In the dark-adapted eye surround latency is longer
              than that of the centre. With increasing background illumination
              the latency difference is reduced. 8. For X-cells, the rate of
              the maintained discharge depends to some extent on the balance of
              centre-surround antagonism. But this antagonism is not the major
              factor accounting for the relative constancy of mean rate at high
              background luminances, for the rate then can be almost
              independent of the size of a steady pot. 9. The mean rate of
              discharge of Y-cells seems to depend even less upon the balance
              of centre-surround antagonism. 10. Y-cell surrounds could not
              properly be isolated with the optimal spot-diffuse illumination
              technique, so detailed measurements of their behaviour were not
              made. However, the dark-adapted surround appear to be as
              sensitive as those of X-cells.",

              daylight, we identify retinal ganglion cell types in the mouse
              that abruptly and reversibly switch the weighting of center and
              surround interactions in their receptive field around cone

              tracing experiments revealed that the circuit element responsible
              for the switch is a large inhibitory neuron that provides direct
              inhibition to ganglion cells. Our experiments suggest that weak

               induced by self-motion. Lobula plate tangential cells of flies
               lend themselves well to study this question because they are
               known to code for ego-motion based on optic-flow. We recorded
               the responses of the lobula plate tangential cell H1 to a visual
               pattern moving at different velocities under three different
               conditions: fixed flies before and after application of the
               octopamine agonist chlordimeform (CDM) and tethered flying
               flies. CDM has been previously shown to induce arousal in flies.
               We found that flying as well as the application of CDM
               significantly broadens the velocity tuning of H1 toward higher
               velocities.",

               space, and chromatic channels. Unlike the former two, chromatic
               integration is largely unexplored. Analogous to classical
               studies of spatial integration, we here study chromatic
               integration in mouse retina by identifying chromatic stimuli for
               which activation from the green or UV color channel is maximally
               balanced by deactivation through the other color channel. This
               reveals nonlinear chromatic integration in subsets of On, Off,

  title    = "A neuronal circuit for colour vision based on rod-cone opponency",
  author   = "Joesch, Maximilian and Meister, Markus",
  abstract = "In bright light, cone-photoreceptors are active and colour vision
              derives from a comparison of signals in cones with different
              visual pigments. This comparison begins in the retina, where
              certain retinal ganglion cells have 'colour-opponent' visual
              responses-excited by light of one colour and suppressed by
              another colour. In dim light, rod-photoreceptors are active, but
              colour vision is impossible because they all use the same visual
              pigment. Instead, the rod signals are thought to splice into
              retinal circuits at various points, in synergy with the cone
              signals. Here we report a new circuit for colour vision that
              challenges these expectations. A genetically identified type of
              mouse retinal ganglion cell called JAMB (J-RGC), was found to
              have colour-opponent responses, OFF to ultraviolet (UV) light and
              ON to green light. Although the mouse retina contains a
              green-sensitive cone, the ON response instead originates in rods.
              Rods and cones both contribute to the response over several
              decades of light intensity. Remarkably, the rod signal in this
              circuit is antagonistic to that from cones. For rodents, this
              UV-green channel may play a role in social communication, as
              suggested by spectral measurements from the environment. In the
              human retina, all of the components for this circuit exist as
              well, and its function can explain certain experiences of colour
              in dim lights, such as a 'blue shift' in twilight. The discovery
              of this genetically defined pathway will enable new targeted
              studies of colour processing in the brain.",

              functions for the mouse obtained from ERG measurements and from

              360 and 509-512 nm. The relative contributions of the two pigment

               These results indicate that processing of visual motion in mouse

  abstract  = "Ultraviolet-A radiation (320?400 nm) is scattered rapidly in
               water. Despite this fact, UV is present in biologically useful
               amounts to at least 100 m deep in clear aquatic environments.
               Discovery of UV visual pigments with peak absorption at around
               360 nm in teleost cone photoreceptors indicates that many
               teleost fishes may be adapted for vision in the UV range.
               Considering the characteristic absorption curve for visual
               pigments, about 18\% of the downwelling light that illuminates
               objects at 30-m depth would be available to UV-sensitive cones.
               Strong scattering of UV radiation should produce unique imaging
               conditions as a very bright UV background in the horizontal view
               and a marked veiling effect that, with distance, obscures an
               image. Many teleosts have three, or even four, classes of cone
               cells mediating colour vision in their retina and one can be
               sensitive to UV. These UV-sensitive cones contain a visual
               pigment based on a unique opsin which is highly conserved
               between fish species. Several powerful methods exist for
               demonstration of UV vision, but all are rather demanding in
               terms of technique and equipment. Demonstration that the eye
               lacks UV-blocking compounds that are present in many fish eyes
               is a simpler method that can indicate the possibility of UV
               vision. The only experimental evidence for the use of UV vision
               by fishes is connected to planktivory: detection of UV-opaque
               objects at close range against a bright UV background is
               enhanced by the physical properties of UV light. Once present,
               perhaps for the function of detecting food, UV vision may well
               be co-opted through natural selection for other functions.
               Recent discovery that UV vision is critically important for mate
               choice in some birds and lizards is a strong object lesson for
               fish ecologists and behaviourists. Other possible functions
               amount to far more than merely adding a fourth dimension to the
               visible spectrum. Since UV is scattered so effectively in water,
               it may be useful for social signalling at short range and reduce
               the possibility of detection by other, illegitimate, receivers.
               Since humans are blind to UV light, we may be significantly in
               error, in many cases, in our attempts to understand and evaluate
               visual aspects of fish behaviour. A survey of the reflectance
               properties of skin pigments in fishes reveals a rich array of
               pigments with reflectance peaks in the UV. For example, the same
               yellow to our eyes may comprise two perceptually different
               colours to fish, yellow and UV-yellow. It is clearly necessary
               for us to anticipate that many fishes may have some form of UV

  abstract = "PURPOSE: The mouse eye is a widely used model for retinal disease
              and has potential to become a model for myopia. Studies of
              retinal disease will benefit from imaging the fundus in vivo.
              Experimental models of myopia often rely on manipulation of the
              visual experience. In both cases, knowledge of the optical
              quality of the eye, and in particular, the retinal image quality
              degradation imposed by the ocular aberrations is essential. In
              this study, we measured the ocular aberrations in the wild type
              mouse. METHODS: Twelve eyes from six four-week old black C57BL/6
              wild type mice were studied. Measurements were done on awake
              animals, one being also measured under anesthesia for comparative
              purposes. Ocular aberrations were measured using a custom-built
              Hartmann-Shack system (using 680-nm illumination). Wave
              aberrations are reported up to fourth order Zernike polynomials.
              Spherical equivalent and astigmatism were obtained from the 2nd
              order Zernike terms. Modulation Transfer Functions (MTF) were
              estimated for the best focus, and through-focus, to estimate
              depth-of-focus. All reported data were for 1.5-mm pupils.
              RESULTS: Hartmann-Shack refractions were consistently hyperopic
              (10.12+/-1.41 D, mean and standard deviation) and astigmatism was
              present in many of the eyes (3.64+/-3.70 D, on average).
              Spherical aberration was positive in all eyes (0.15+/-0.07
              microm) and coma terms RMS were significantly high compared to
              other Zernike terms (0.10+/-0.03 microm). MTFs estimated from
              wave aberrations show a modulation of 0.4 at 2c/deg, for best
              focus (and 0.15 without cancelling the measured defocus). For
              that spatial frequency, depth-of-focus estimated from
              through-focus modulation data using the Rayleigh criterion was
              6D. Aberrations in the eye of one anesthetized mouse were higher
              than in the same eye of the awake animal. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperopic
              refractions in the mouse eye are consistent with previous
              retinoscopic data. The optics of the mouse eye is far from being
              diffraction-limited at 1.5-mm pupil, with significant amounts of

              unrestrained animal which is quiescent, the descending
              contralateral movement detector (DCMD) neurone shows an
              exponential decremental response to a repetitive stimulus
              (habituation), reaching a plateau level characteristic of the
              stimulus conditions. The process is site-specific on the retina,
              and movement to a new area of retina gives a complete recovery.
              In the absence of stimulation responsiveness returns over minutes
              or hours. 2. Immediate recovery without a rest (dishabituation)
              can be obtained by a variety of strong sensory stimuli of several
              different modalities (`extra-stimuli') or by non specific
              electrical stimulation of parts of the CNS. The dishabituating
              efficacy of all these wanes with repetition. When the habituating
              stimulus is moved to a new retinal site the previous site is not
              dishabituated. 3. Dishabituation is not site-specific but affects
              the whole retina simultaneously. It appears to reverse the
              original decremental process (`re-set') rather than to produce an
              independent enhancement elsewhere in the pathway, as it does not
              increase the response from a submaximally stimulated, but
              unhabituated, retinal site. 4. In unrestrained animals
              dishabituating extra-stimuli also cause behavioural arousal or
              other motor activity. When motor activity starts, the DCMD is
              dishabituated and shows no regular decremental trend thereafter
              until movement ceases. DCMD background activity is also
              increased. These effects are not due to the visual stimulus of
              the moving appendages. 5. The association between motor activity
              and dishabituation suggests that the latter derives either from
              motor system collaterals or from mechanoreceptive reafference.
              Stimulation of the antennal nerve of a totally de-efferented
              brain cause some dishabituation; this eliminates the lower motor
              system (below command-fibre level) as the source of
              dishabituation and suggests it is purely sensory. 6. The activity
              of a thoracic cord unit (of possibly a wide-field mechanoreceptor
              interneurone) precedes by 5-20 sec, and closely correlates with,
              changes in responsiveness of the DCMD. It is either an important
              input to, or an output from, the dishabituating system. 7.
              Progressive reduction of sensory input to the brain affects DCMD
              responsiveness as follows: (i) spontaneous dishabituation is less
              frequent, (ii) dishabituation is less easily induced and smaller,
              (iii) rate of habituation is increased, (iv) plateau response
              level after habituation is lower. 8. Electrical stimulation of
              the circumoesophageal connective can depress DCMD responsiveness
              for many minutes. 9. The probable anatomical and physiological
              bases for modulation of DCMD responsiveness are discussed.",

              neural activity. A fundamental tenet of this approach is that the
              response properties of neurons in one context, e.g. color
              stimuli, are representative of responses in other contexts, e.g.
              natural scenes. This assumption is not often tested. Here, for
              neurons in macaque area V4, we first estimated tuning curves for
              hue by presenting artificial stimuli of varying hue, and then
              tested whether these would correlate with hue tuning curves
              estimated from responses to natural images. We found that

              neurons in V4 respond to interactions between hue and other

               the balance of input to mouse V1, in the anesthetized setup,
               from the three main photoreceptor opsins---M-opsin, S-opsin, and
               rhodopsin---as a function of two stimulus dimensions. The first

               encircled by regions in which the intrinsic signal dropped below
               baseline, suggesting the presence of strong surround inhibition.
               Single-unit recordings revealed that this decrease of the
               intrinsic signal indeed correlated with a drop of neuronal
               firing rate below baseline. The averaged maps also greatly
               facilitated the identification of extrastriate visual activity,
               pointing to at least four extrastriate visual areas in the
               mouse. We conclude that optical imaging is ideally suited to
               visualize retinotopic maps in mice, thus making this a powerful
               technique for the analysis of map structure in transgenic

              GABAergic interneuron that samples from all cone photoreceptors
              within reach and modulates their glutamatergic output via
              parallel feedback mechanisms. Because horizontal cells form an
              electrically coupled network, they have been implicated in global
              signal processing, such as large-scale contrast enhancement.
              Recently, it has been proposed that horizontal cells can also act
              locally at the level of individual cone photoreceptors. To test
              this possibility physiologically, we used two-photon microscopy
              to record light stimulus-evoked Ca2+ signals in cone axon
              terminals and horizontal cell dendrites as well as glutamate
              release in the outer plexiform layer. By selectively stimulating
              the two mouse cone opsins with green and UV light, we assessed
              whether signals from individual cones remain isolated within
              horizontal cell dendritic tips or whether they spread across the
              dendritic arbor. Consistent with the mouse's opsin expression
              gradient, we found that the Ca2+ signals recorded from dendrites
              of dorsal horizontal cells were dominated by M-opsin and those of
              ventral horizontal cells by S-opsin activation. The signals
              measured in neighboring horizontal cell dendritic tips varied
              markedly in their chromatic preference, arguing against global
              processing. Rather, our experimental data and results from
              biophysically realistic modeling support the idea that horizontal
              cells can process cone input locally, extending the classical
              view of horizontal cell function. Pharmacologically removing
              horizontal cells from the circuitry reduced the sensitivity of
              the cone signal to low frequencies, suggesting that local

                   speeds up learning in deep neural networks and leads to
                   higher classification accuracies. Like rectified linear
                   units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs
                   (PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via
                   the identity for positive values. However, ELUs have
                   improved learning characteristics compared to the units with
                   other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have
                   negative values which allows them to push mean unit
                   activations closer to zero like batch normalization but with
                   lower computational complexity. Mean shifts toward zero
                   speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to
                   the unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift
                   effect. While LReLUs and PReLUs have negative values, too,
                   they do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. ELUs
                   saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and thereby
                   decrease the forward propagated variation and information.
                   Therefore, ELUs code the degree of presence of particular
                   phenomena in the input, while they do not quantitatively
                   model the degree of their absence. In experiments, ELUs lead
                   not only to faster learning, but also to significantly
                   better generalization performance than ReLUs and LReLUs on
                   networks with more than 5 layers. On CIFAR-100 ELUs networks
                   significantly outperform ReLU networks with batch
                   normalization while batch normalization does not improve ELU

               the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful
               parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train
               models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this
               phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem
               by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from
               making normalization a part of the model architecture and
               performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch
               Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be

              understanding of the mouse eye to validate its use in different
              experimental setting. The purpose of this study was to determine
              the ocular transmittance of the whole mouse eye, the cornea and
              the crystalline lens, particularly in the ultraviolet radiation
              (UVR) wavebands. This was carried out using a non-cuvette based

              curves were compared with published cone spectral response curves
              and mouse ocular transmittance data. First, transmittance curves
              of the whole mouse eye were measured by removing a small disc of
              sclera from the posterior pole to provide an anterior to
              posterior optical path. No statistical difference was found
              between left and right eye in each of the four mice sampled,
              therefore, all eight eyes were included in the final statistical
              analysis. The average of five test measurements from each left
              and right eye for the four test mice showed a transmittance cut
              off at approximately 310 nm. Secondly, the cornea with a scleral
              rim was excised and transmittance curves obtained for all eight
              eyes. This data showed an average transmittance cut off at 280 nm
              for the cornea. Similarly measured data for the excised
              crystalline lens showed UVR transmittance down to 310 nm. The
              good correlation between total ocular UVR transmittance and the
              sum of the individually measured components (i.e. the cornea and
              the crystalline lens) supported the validity of our method and
              its findings. This experiment demonstrated that the mouse cornea
              transmits more UV-B (280-315 nm) than the rabbit and the human
              corneal transmittance. The mouse crystalline lens on the other
              hand showed a cut off in the UV-B at 310 nm, which is at a much
              lower UV-B wavelength than the approximate UV-A (315-400 nm) cut
              off for the human crystalline lens at around 390 nm. The
              increased transmittance of UVR in the mouse eye serves its
              vision, since the mouse has a cone photopigment peaking at
              approximately 350 nm. Due to the above stated differences between
              the mouse and the human it is concluded that the mouse is not an
              ideal model for the human eye in experiments involving UVR.",

              close to the equator in the same eyes. To evaluate inter-eye and
              inter-individual variability, a total of 20 mice (34 eyes) were
              studied, with 3-4 eyes for each of the 9 sampling ages. Schematic
              eye models were developed using paraxial ray tracing software
              (OSLO, LT Lambda Research Corporation, and a self-written
              program). RESULTS: The measured refractive errors were initially
              +4.0+/-0.6 D at approximately 30 days, and levelled off with
              +7.0+/-2.5 D at about 70 days. Corneal radius of curvature did
              not change with age (1.414+/-0.019 mm). Both axial lens diameter
              and axial eye length grew linearly (regression equations: lens,
              1619 microm +5.5 microm/day, R=0.916; axial length, 2899 microm
              +4.4 microm/day, R=0.936). The lens grew so fast that vitreous
              chamber depth declined with age (regression equation: 896 microm
              -3.2 microm/day, R=0.685). The radii of curvature of the anterior
              lens surface increased during development (from 0.982 mm at day
              22 to 1.208 mm at day 100), whereas the radii of the posterior
              lens surface remained constant (-1.081+/-0.054 mm). The
              calculated homogeneous lens index increased linearly with age
              (from 1.568 to 1.605). The small eye artifact, calculated from
              the dioptric difference of the positions of the vitreo-retinal
              interface and the photoreceptor plane, increased from +35.2 to
              +39.1 D, which was much higher than the hyperopia measured with
              photorefraction. Retinal image magnification increased from 31 to
              34 microm/deg, and the f/number remained < or =1 at all ages,
              suggesting a bright retinal image. A calculated axial eye
              elongation of 5.4-6.5 microm was sufficient to make the schematic
              eye 1 D more myopic. CONCLUSIONS: The most striking features of
              the mouse eye were that linear growth was slow but extended far
              beyond sexual maturity, that the corneal curvature did not
              increase, and that the prominent lens growth caused a
              developmental decline of the vitreous chamber depth.",

  abstract = "Ultraviolet-A radiation (320?400 nm) is scattered rapidly in
              water. Despite this fact, UV is present in biologically useful
              amounts to at least 100 m deep in clear aquatic environments.
              Discovery of UV visual pigments with peak absorption at around
              360 nm in teleost cone photoreceptors indicates that many teleost
              fishes may be adapted for vision in the UV range. Considering the
              characteristic absorption curve for visual pigments, about 18\%
              of the downwelling light that illuminates objects at 30-m depth
              would be available to UV-sensitive cones. Strong scattering of UV
              radiation should produce unique imaging conditions as a very
              bright UV background in the horizontal view and a marked veiling
              effect that, with distance, obscures an image. Many teleosts have
              three, or even four, classes of cone cells mediating colour
              vision in their retina and one can be sensitive to UV. These
              UV-sensitive cones contain a visual pigment based on a unique
              opsin which is highly conserved between fish species. Several
              powerful methods exist for demonstration of UV vision, but all
              are rather demanding in terms of technique and equipment.
              Demonstration that the eye lacks UV-blocking compounds that are
              present in many fish eyes is a simpler method that can indicate
              the possibility of UV vision. The only experimental evidence for
              the use of UV vision by fishes is connected to planktivory:
              detection of UV-opaque objects at close range against a bright UV
              background is enhanced by the physical properties of UV light.
              Once present, perhaps for the function of detecting food, UV
              vision may well be co-opted through natural selection for other
              functions. Recent discovery that UV vision is critically
              important for mate choice in some birds and lizards is a strong
              object lesson for fish ecologists and behaviourists. Other
              possible functions amount to far more than merely adding a fourth
              dimension to the visible spectrum. Since UV is scattered so
              effectively in water, it may be useful for social signalling at
              short range and reduce the possibility of detection by other,
              illegitimate, receivers. Since humans are blind to UV light, we
              may be significantly in error, in many cases, in our attempts to
              understand and evaluate visual aspects of fish behaviour. A
              survey of the reflectance properties of skin pigments in fishes
              reveals a rich array of pigments with reflectance peaks in the
              UV. For example, the same yellow to our eyes may comprise two
              perceptually different colours to fish, yellow and UV-yellow. It
              is clearly necessary for us to anticipate that many fishes may
              have some form of UV vision.",

              the eye transmit ultraviolet (UV) light, and the retinae respond
              to it electro-physiologically. Here we tie this finding to the
              unusual visual environment experienced by these animals and
              propose that their sensitivity to UV light enhances vision at the
              low luminance characteristic of the polar winter. For such visual
              enhancement to occur, it is essential that functional components
              of the environment, such as forage plants, be visually salient
              under natural UV luminance. However, it is not self-evident that
              this is the case. Although organic material generally absorbs UV
              radiation, powerful scattering of UV light by snow crystals may
              reduce the contrast with the background. We therefore recorded UV
              images of vegetation in situ on snow-covered pasture under
              natural winter (March) luminance in northern Norway. For each
              vegetation scene, we made three monochrome digital images, at 350
              -- 390 nm (UV-Only), 400 -- 750 nm (No-UV), and 350 -- 750 nm
              (control), respectively. Plants at the snow surface appeared in
              high achromatic contrast against snow in UV-Only images. The
              contrast was substantially greater in the UV-Only images than in
              corresponding images in which UV was blocked. We conclude that
              plants are visually salient under natural UV luminance at
              wavelengths to which Rangifer are sensitive. This sensitivity is
              likely to improve the animals' ability to discriminate forage in

               feature of the visual information is the wavelength difference
               of light emittedfrom light sources or reflectedfrom objects.
               Under natural conditions, a general difference in the spectral
               composition of light is based upon the fact that light coming
               directly from light sources, e.g., the sun, sky, and moon, is
               characterized by its relatively high content of short wavelength
               (450nm) (Figs. 1). The physical basis of these differences is
               the preferential absorption by pigment molecules, which---in
               contrast to atoms and small molecules---have resonances above
               300 nm and shift the bulk of the reflected light into the green
               and orange region of the spectrum. In water, the wavelength
               range is compressed in the long-wavelength part of the spectrum
               due to water's high absorption of red and infrared light (Fig.
               1). But in water, too, direct light is relatively richer in
               shortwave light. Neglecting the finer differences in the
               spectral content of light, this general distinction between
               direct and reflected light could be the cue that allows an
               animal to differentiate such basically different habitats as
               open spaces, shadowed areas, spaces rich in food, hiding places,

  abstract = "Ultraviolet (UV) light occupies the spectral range of wavelengths
              slightly shorter than those visible to humans. Because of its
              shorter wavelength, it is more energetic (and potentially more
              photodamaging) than 'visible light', and it is scattered more
              efficiently in air and water. Until 1990, only a few animals were
              recognized as being sensitive to UV light, but we now know that a
              great diversity, possibly even the majority, of animal species
              can visually detect and respond to it. Here, we discuss the
              history of research on biological UV photosensitivity and review
              current major research trends in this field. Some animals use
              their UV photoreceptors to control simple, innate behaviors, but
              most incorporate their UV receptors into their general sense of
              vision. They not only detect UV light but recognize it as a
              separate color in light fields, on natural objects or living
              organisms, or in signals displayed by conspecifics. UV visual
              pigments are based on opsins, the same family of proteins that
              are used to detect light in conventional photoreceptors. Despite
              some interesting exceptions, most animal species have a single
              photoreceptor class devoted to the UV. The roles of UV in vision
              are manifold, from guiding navigation and orientation behavior,
              to detecting food and potential predators, to supporting
              high-level tasks such as mate assessment and intraspecific
              communication. Our current understanding of UV vision is

              {V1}",
  author   = "Dadarlat, Maria C and Stryker, Michael P",
  abstract = "Neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) are selective for
              particular properties of visual stimuli. Locomotion causes a
              change in cortical state that leaves their selectivity unchanged
              but strengthens their responses. Both locomotion and the change
              in cortical state are thought to be initiated by projections from
              the mesencephalic locomotor region, the latter through a
              disinhibitory circuit in V1. By recording simultaneously from a
              large number of single neurons in alert mice viewing moving
              gratings, we investigated the relationship between locomotion and
              the information contained within the neural population. We found
              that locomotion improved encoding of visual stimuli in V1 by two
              mechanisms. First, locomotion-induced increases in firing rates
              enhanced the mutual information between visual stimuli and single
              neuron responses over a fixed window of time. Second, stimulus
              discriminability was improved, even for fixed population firing
              rates, because of a decrease in noise correlations across the
              population. These two mechanisms contributed differently to
              improvements in discriminability across cortical layers, with
              changes in firing rates most important in the upper layers and
              changes in noise correlations most important in layer V.
              Together, these changes resulted in a threefold to fivefold
              reduction in the time needed to precisely encode grating
              direction and orientation. These results support the hypothesis
              that cortical state shifts during locomotion to accommodate an
              increased load on the visual system when mice are
              moving.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This paper contains three novel
              findings about the representation of information in neurons
              within the primary visual cortex of the mouse. First, we show
              that locomotion reduces by at least a factor of 3 the time needed
              for information to accumulate in the visual cortex that allows
              the distinction of different visual stimuli. Second, we show that
              the effect of locomotion is to increase information in cells of
              all layers of the visual cortex. Third, we show that the means by
              which information is enhanced by locomotion differs between the
              upper layers, where the major effect is the increasing of firing
              rates, and in layer V, where the major effect is the reduction in
              noise correlations.",

              these state transitions in multiple cortical areas. During

              modulated by factors beyond direct sensory stimulation. In
              primary visual cortex (V1), for instance, responses increase with
              locomotion. Here we show that this increase is accompanied by a
              profound change in spatial integration. We recorded from V1
              neurons in head-fixed mice placed on a spherical treadmill. We
              characterized spatial integration and found that the responses of
              most neurons were suppressed by large stimuli. As in primates,
              this surround suppression increased with stimulus contrast. These
              effects were captured by a divisive normalization model, where
              the numerator originates from a central region driving the neuron
              and the denominator originates from a larger suppressive field.
              We then studied the effects of locomotion and found that it
              markedly reduced surround suppression, allowing V1 neurons to
              integrate over larger regions of visual space. Locomotion had two
              main effects: it increased spontaneous activity, and it weakened
              the suppressive signals mediating normalization, relative to the
              driving signals. We conclude that a fundamental aspect of visual
              processing, spatial integration, is controlled by an apparently
              unrelated factor, locomotion. This control might operate through
              the mechanisms that are in place to deliver surround suppression.",

              of visual stimulation and largely through nicotinic inputs from

              (F0) ratios of LGN DS cells are strongly nonlinear, those of

              pathways to the central visual system. Like other dichromats, the
              mouse retina expresses a short-wavelength (S) and a
              medium-wavelength (M) opsin, with the S-opsin shifted to peak
              sensitivity in the ultraviolet (UV) range. Unlike in primates,
              nonuniform opsin expression across the retina and coexpression in

              responses in the dorsal lateral geniculate and of the local field
              potentials in their recipient zone in primary visual cortex (V1).
              We used an immersive visual stimulus dome that allowed us to
              present spatiotemporally modulated UV and green luminance in any
              region of the visual field of an awake, head-fixed mouse.
              Consistent with retinal expression of opsins, we observed graded
              UV-to-green dominated responses from the upper to lower visual
              fields, with a smaller difference across azimuth. In addition, we

              mosaic, which provides a solid foundation to study how the cortex
              pools from afferent parallel color channels. In particular, the
              mouse's retinal mosaic exhibits a gradient of wavelength
              sensitivity along its dorsoventral axis. Cones at the ventral
              extreme mainly express S opsin, which is sensitive to ultraviolet

              wavelength sensitivity. We first identified visual areas in each
              mouse by mapping retinotopy with intrinsic signal imaging (ISI).
              Next, we measured ISI responses to stimuli along different
              directions of the S- and M-color plane to quantify the magnitude
              of S and M input to each location of the retinotopic maps in five

              along the axis of vertical retinotopy that is consistent with the
              gradient along the dorsoventral axis of the retina. In

              responded to S-opsin contrast with 6.1-fold greater amplitude

                   trivial coordinate transform problem, which simply requires
                   learning a mapping between coordinates in (x,y) Cartesian

                   coordinates through the use of extra coordinate channels.
                   Without sacrificing the computational and parametric
                   efficiency of ordinary convolution, CoordConv allows
                   networks to learn either complete translation invariance or

                   stark contrast raises the question: to what extent has this
                   inability of convolution persisted insidiously inside other
                   tasks, subtly hampering performance from within? A complete
                   answer to this question will require further investigation,
                   but we show preliminary evidence that swapping convolution
                   for CoordConv can improve models on a diverse set of tasks.
                   Using CoordConv in a GAN produced less mode collapse as the
                   transform between high-level spatial latents and pixels
                   becomes easier to learn. A Faster R-CNN detection model
                   trained on MNIST showed 24\% better IOU when using
                   CoordConv, and in the RL domain agents playing Atari games
                   benefit significantly from the use of CoordConv layers.",

              spectra of the light sources, because they rely on off-the-shelf
              technology developed for human trichromatic vision. Importantly,
              consumer displays fail to drive UV-shifted short
              wavelength-sensitive photoreceptors, which strongly contribute to
              visual behaviour in many animals, including mice, zebrafish and
              fruit flies. Moreover, many non-mammalian species feature more
              than three spectral photoreceptor types. Here, we present a
              flexible, spatial visual stimulator with up to six arbitrary
              spectrum chromatic channels. It combines a standard digital light
              processing engine with open source hard- and software that can be
              easily adapted to the experimentalist's needs. We demonstrate the
              capability of this general visual stimulator experimentally in

  abstract = "We do not fully understand how behavioral state modulates the
              processing and transmission of sensory signals. Here, we studied
              the cortical representation of the retinal image in mice that
              spontaneously switched between a state of rest and a constricted
              pupil, and one of active locomotion and a dilated pupil,
              indicative of heightened attention. We measured the selectivity
              of neurons in primary visual cortex for orientation and spatial
              frequency, as well as their response gain, in these two
              behavioral states. Consistent with prior studies, we found that
              preferred orientation and spatial frequency remained invariant
              across states, whereas response gain increased during locomotion
              relative to rest. Surprisingly, relative gain, defined as the
              ratio between the gain during locomotion and the gain during
              rest, was not uniform across the population. Cells tuned to high
              spatial frequencies showed larger relative gain compared with
              those tuned to lower spatial frequencies. The preferential
              enhancement of high-spatial-frequency information was also
              reflected in our ability to decode the stimulus from population
              activity. Finally, we show that changes in gain originate from
              shifts in the operating point of neurons along a spiking
              nonlinearity as a function of behavioral state. Differences in
              the relative gain experienced by neurons with high and low
              spatial frequencies are due to corresponding differences in how
              these cells shift their operating points between behavioral
              states. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT How behavioral state modulates the
              processing and transmission of sensory signals remains poorly
              understood. Here, we show that the mean firing rate and neuronal
              gain increase during locomotion as a result in a shift of the
              operating point of neurons. We define relative gain as the ratio
              between the gain of neurons during locomotion and rest.
              Interestingly, relative gain is higher in cells with preferences
              for higher spatial frequencies than those with
              low-spatial-frequency selectivity. This means that, during a
              state of locomotion and heightened attention, the population
              activity in primary visual cortex can support better spatial
              acuity, a phenomenon that parallels the improved spatial
              resolution observed in human subjects during the allocation of
              spatial attention.",

abstract = {Particular deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) are today's most accurate models of the primate brain's ventral visual stream. Using an ANN-driven image synthesis method, we found that luminous power patterns (i.e., images) can be applied to primate retinae to predictably push the spiking activity of targeted V4 neural sites beyond naturally occurring levels. This method, although not yet perfect, achieves unprecedented independent control of the activity state of entire populations of V4 neural sites, even those with overlapping receptive fields. These results show how the knowledge embedded in today's ANN models might be used to noninvasively set desired internal brain states at neuron-level resolution, and suggest that more accurate ANN models would produce even more accurate control.},

  abstract = "Components of neural circuits are often repurposed so that the
              same biological hardware can be used for distinct computations.
              This flexibility in circuit operation is required to account for
              the changes in sensory computations that accompany changes in
              input signals. Yet we know little about how such changes in
              circuit operation are implemented. Here we show that a single
              retinal ganglion cell performs a different computation in dim
              light--averaging contrast within its receptive field--than in
              brighter light, when the cell becomes sensitive to fine spatial
              detail. This computational change depends on interactions between
              two parallel circuits that control the ganglion cell's excitatory
              synaptic inputs. Specifically, steady-state interactions through
              dendro-axonal gap junctions control rectification of the synapses
              providing excitatory input to the ganglion cell. These findings

              that depends on behavioral state. In the visual thalamus and
              cortex, arousal and locomotion are associated with changes in the
              magnitude of responses to visual stimuli. Here, we asked whether
              such modulation of visual responses might already occur at an
              earlier stage in this visual pathway. We measured neural activity
              of retinal axons using wide-field and two-photon calcium imaging
              in awake mouse thalamus across arousal states associated with
              different pupil sizes. Surprisingly, visual responses to drifting
              gratings in retinal axonal boutons were robustly modulated by
              arousal level in a manner that varied across stimulus dimensions
              and across functionally distinct subsets of boutons. At low and
              intermediate spatial frequencies, the majority of boutons were
              suppressed by arousal. In contrast, at high spatial frequencies,
              boutons tuned to regions of visual space ahead of the mouse
              showed enhancement of responses. Arousal-related modulation also
              varied with a bouton's preference for luminance changes and
              direction or axis of motion, with greater response suppression in
              boutons tuned to luminance decrements versus increments, and in
              boutons preferring motion along directions or axes of optic flow.
              Together, our results suggest that differential modulation of
              distinct visual information channels by arousal state occurs at
              very early stages of visual processing, before the information is
              transmitted to neurons in visual thalamus. Such early filtering

  abstract = "A central challenge in sensory neuroscience is to understand
              neural computations and circuit mechanisms that underlie the
              encoding of ethologically relevant, natural stimuli. In
              multilayered neural circuits, nonlinear processes such as
              synaptic transmission and spiking dynamics present a significant
              obstacle to the creation of accurate computational models of
              responses to natural stimuli. Here we demonstrate that deep
              convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture retinal responses to
              natural scenes nearly to within the variability of a cell's
              response, and are markedly more accurate than linear-nonlinear
              (LN) models and Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Moreover, we
              find two additional surprising properties of CNNs: they are less
              susceptible to overfitting than their LN counterparts when
              trained on small amounts of data, and generalize better when
              tested on stimuli drawn from a different distribution (e.g.
              between natural scenes and white noise). An examination of the
              learned CNNs reveals several properties. First, a richer set of
              feature maps is necessary for predicting the responses to natural
              scenes compared to white noise. Second, temporally precise
              responses to slowly varying inputs originate from feedforward
              inhibition, similar to known retinal mechanisms. Third, the
              injection of latent noise sources in intermediate layers enables
              our model to capture the sub-Poisson spiking variability observed
              in retinal ganglion cells. Fourth, augmenting our CNNs with
              recurrent lateral connections enables them to capture contrast
              adaptation as an emergent property of accurately describing
              retinal responses to natural scenes. These methods can be readily
              generalized to other sensory modalities and stimulus ensembles.
              Overall, this work demonstrates that CNNs not only accurately
              capture sensory circuit responses to natural scenes, but also can
              yield information about the circuit's internal structure and
              function.",

  abstract  = "Neuroscientists classify neurons into different types that
               perform similar computations at different locations in the
               visual field. Traditional methods for neural system
               identification do not capitalize on this separation of 'what'
               and 'where'. Learning deep convolutional feature spaces that are
               shared among many neurons provides an exciting path forward, but
               the architectural design needs to account for data limitations:
               While new experimental techniques enable recordings from
               thousands of neurons, experimental time is limited so that one
               can sample only a small fraction of each neuron's response
               space. Here, we show that a major bottleneck for fitting
               convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to neural data is the
               estimation of the individual receptive field locations, a
               problem that has been scratched only at the surface thus far. We
               propose a CNN architecture with a sparse readout layer
               factorizing the spatial (where) and feature (what) dimensions.
               Our network scales well to thousands of neurons and short
               recordings and can be trained end-to-end. We evaluate this
               architecture on ground-truth data to explore the challenges and
               limitations of CNN-based system identification. Moreover, we
               show that our network model outperforms current state-of-the art
               system identification models of mouse primary visual cortex.",

  abstract = {Divisive normalization (DN) is a prominent computational building block in the brain that has been proposed as a canonical cortical operation. Numerous experimental studies have verified its importance for capturing nonlinear neural response properties to simple, artificial stimuli, and computational studies suggest that DN is also an important component for processing natural stimuli. However, we lack quantitative models of DN that are directly informed by measurements of spiking responses in the brain and applicable to arbitrary stimuli. Here, we propose a DN model that is applicable to arbitrary input images. We test its ability to predict how neurons in macaque primary visual cortex (V1) respond to natural images, with a focus on nonlinear response properties within the classical receptive field. Our model consists of one layer of subunits followed by learned orientation-specific DN. It outperforms linear-nonlinear and wavelet-based feature representations and makes a significant step towards the performance of state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Unlike deep CNNs, our compact DN model offers a direct interpretation of the nature of normalization. By inspecting the learned normalization pool of our model, we gained insights into a long-standing question about the tuning properties of DN that update the current textbook description: we found that within the receptive field oriented features were normalized preferentially by features with similar orientation rather than non-specifically as currently assumed.},

  abstract = "Primary visual cortex (V1) is the first stage of cortical image
              processing, and a major effort in systems neuroscience is devoted
              to understanding how it encodes information about visual stimuli.
              Within V1, many neurons respond selectively to edges of a given
              preferred orientation: these are known as simple or complex
              cells, and they are well-studied. Other neurons respond to
              localized center-surround image features. Still others respond
              selectively to certain image stimuli, but the specific features
              that excite them are unknown. Moreover, even for the simple and
              complex cells-- the best-understood V1 neurons-- it is
              challenging to predict how they will respond to natural image
              stimuli. Thus, there are important gaps in our understanding of
              how V1 encodes images. To fill this gap, we train deep
              convolutional neural networks to predict the firing rates of V1
              neurons in response to natural image stimuli, and find that 15\%
              of these neurons are within 10\% of their theoretical limit of
              predictability. For these well predicted neurons, we invert the
              predictor network to identify the image features (receptive
              fields) that cause the V1 neurons to spike. In addition to those
              with previously-characterized receptive fields (Gabor wavelet and
              center-surround), we identify neurons that respond predictably to
              higher-level textural image features that are not localized to
              any particular region of the image.",
