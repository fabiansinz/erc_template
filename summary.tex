Sensory systems are our window to the world around us and provide the basis for our decisions and behavior. 
However, sensory processing is not a one-way street:
It is known that motor behavior and the internal state of an animal can change the way how sensory signals are processed, not only through attention but also through changing the selectivity of  neurons itself. 
Previous work has shown that these changes can temporarily sharpen the focus of the brain to certain aspects of the environment.
These changes are temporary which suggests that sensory certainty is a limited resource that has to be spent wisely depending on the behavioral context.
However, because the vast majority of studies are performed in head-fixed animals with limited behavioral options, it is not clear how and when the brain adjusts sensory systems during real-world, unconfined behavior. 
I hypothesize that changes in neuronal selectivity happen frequently during free behavior and adapt sensory systems to the current behavioral needs by decreasing uncertainty about relevant aspects of the world.

I propose investigate this idea by building data-driven functional twins of mice in a digitized version of a real environment using state of the art machine learning and a massive dataset of recordings from visual cortex of head-fixed and freely behaving mice under spontaneous and goal-driven behavior.
I will use this twin to characterize which neurons change their tuning, how and under which behavioral context they change it, and how behavior would be expected to change if these mechanisms were turned off.
If successful, this project can change our view on how the visual system adapts with behavior in real world behavior. 
The proposed computational framework is straightforward to generalize to other areas, stimulus modalities, and species, and will be an enabling tool for neuroscience in unconfined animals in natural environments, taking an important step towards a standard model of systems neuroscience.
