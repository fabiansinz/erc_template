                   then extract a policy from that cost function with

  abstract = "A central challenge in sensory neuroscience is to understand
              neural computations and circuit mechanisms that underlie the
              encoding of ethologically relevant, natural stimuli. In
              multilayered neural circuits, nonlinear processes such as
              synaptic transmission and spiking dynamics present a significant
              obstacle to the creation of accurate computational models of
              responses to natural stimuli. Here we demonstrate that deep
              convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture retinal responses to
              natural scenes nearly to within the variability of a cell's
              response, and are markedly more accurate than linear-nonlinear
              (LN) models and Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Moreover, we
              find two additional surprising properties of CNNs: they are less
              susceptible to overfitting than their LN counterparts when
              trained on small amounts of data, and generalize better when
              tested on stimuli drawn from a different distribution (e.g.
              between natural scenes and white noise). An examination of the
              learned CNNs reveals several properties. First, a richer set of
              feature maps is necessary for predicting the responses to natural
              scenes compared to white noise. Second, temporally precise
              responses to slowly varying inputs originate from feedforward
              inhibition, similar to known retinal mechanisms. Third, the
              injection of latent noise sources in intermediate layers enables
              our model to capture the sub-Poisson spiking variability observed
              in retinal ganglion cells. Fourth, augmenting our CNNs with
              recurrent lateral connections enables them to capture contrast
              adaptation as an emergent property of accurately describing
              retinal responses to natural scenes. These methods can be readily
              generalized to other sensory modalities and stimulus ensembles.
              Overall, this work demonstrates that CNNs not only accurately
              capture sensory circuit responses to natural scenes, but also can
              yield information about the circuit's internal structure and
              function.",

                   The survey formally introduces the IRL problem along with
                   its central challenges such as the difficulty in performing
                   accurate inference and its generalizability, its sensitivity

              (DNNs) provide a promising candidate for such a model. However,
              DNNs require orders of magnitude more training data than
              neuroscientists can collect from real neurons because
              experimental recording time is severely limited. This motivates

              little training data as possible. We propose gaudy
              images---high-contrast binarized versions of natural images---to
              efficiently train DNNs. In extensive simulation experiments, we
              find that training DNNs with gaudy images substantially reduces

              gaudy images, chosen before training, outperform images chosen
              during training by active learning algorithms. Thus, gaudy images
              overemphasize features of natural images, especially edges, that
              are the most important for efficiently training DNNs. We believe

                   the transformer version offers dramatic performance gains
                   over the neuroscience version. This work continues to bind

                   together with simultaneous behavioral measurements that
                   include running speed, pupil dilation, and eye movements.
                   The benchmark challenge will rank models based on predictive
                   performance for neuronal responses on a held-out test set,

                   lauded as the current best models of information processing
                   in the brain, but also criticized for failing to account for
                   basic cognitive functions. We propose that arguing about the

                   is the wrong approach to assess the promise of
                   neuroconnectionism. Instead, we take inspiration from the

                   showed that the core of scientific research programmes is

                   morphological perturbations. Learning to locomote when the
                   length and the thickness of different body parts vary is
                   challenging, as the control policy is required to adapt to
                   the morphology to successfully balance and advance the
                   agent. We show that a control policy based on the
                   proprioceptive state performs poorly with highly variable
                   body configurations, while an (oracle) agent with access to
                   a learned encoding of the perturbation performs
                   significantly better. We introduce DMAP, a
                   biologically-inspired, attention-based policy network
                   architecture. DMAP combines independent proprioceptive
                   processing, a distributed policy with individual controllers

                   downstream tasks. This study shows that previous attempts,
                   which account for these ambiguities via multiple hypotheses

                   that miscalibration can be attributed to the use of
                   sample-based metrics such as minMPJPE. In a series of

                   However, it fails to correctly capture the uncertainty, thus

  abstract      = "Classifying the behavior of humans or animals from videos is
                   important in biomedical fields for understanding brain
                   function and response to stimuli. Action recognition,
                   classifying activities performed by one or more subjects in
                   a trimmed video, forms the basis of many of these
                   techniques. Deep learning models for human action
                   recognition have progressed significantly over the last
                   decade. Recently, there is an increased interest in research
                   that incorporates deep learning-based action recognition for
                   animal behavior classification. However, human action
                   recognition methods are more developed. This survey presents
                   an overview of human action recognition and pose estimation
                   methods that are based on convolutional neural network (CNN)
                   architectures and have been adapted for animal behavior
                   classification in neuroscience. Pose estimation, estimating
                   joint positions from an image frame, is included because it
                   is often applied before classifying animal behavior. First,
                   we provide foundational information on algorithms that learn
                   spatiotemporal features through 2D, two-stream, and 3D CNNs.
                   We explore motivating factors that determine optimizers,
                   loss functions and training procedures, and compare their
                   performance on benchmark datasets. Next, we review animal
                   behavior frameworks that use or build upon these methods,
                   organized by the level of supervision they require. Our
                   discussion is uniquely focused on the technical evolution of
                   the underlying CNN models and their architectural
                   adaptations (which we illustrate), rather than their
                   usability in a neuroscience lab. We conclude by discussing

              whisking is therefore driven by at least two distinct signals

              glutamatergic excitation of the cortex and increased cholinergic
              input suppressing spontaneous cortical activity.",

              modulated by factors beyond direct sensory stimulation. In
              primary visual cortex (V1), for instance, responses increase with
              locomotion. Here we show that this increase is accompanied by a
              profound change in spatial integration. We recorded from V1
              neurons in head-fixed mice placed on a spherical treadmill. We
              characterized spatial integration and found that the responses of
              most neurons were suppressed by large stimuli. As in primates,
              this surround suppression increased with stimulus contrast. These
              effects were captured by a divisive normalization model, where
              the numerator originates from a central region driving the neuron
              and the denominator originates from a larger suppressive field.
              We then studied the effects of locomotion and found that it
              markedly reduced surround suppression, allowing V1 neurons to
              integrate over larger regions of visual space. Locomotion had two

              little study, perhaps due to difficulties in controlling eye
              position in this state. In rabbits, eye position is exceedingly
              stable in both alert and inattentive states. Here, we exploit
              this stability to examine temporal filtering of visual
              information in LGNd neurons as rabbits alternate between
              EEG-defined states. Within a single second of shifting from alert
              to an inattentive state, both peak temporal frequency and

              dramatically. However, spatial dimensions of receptive field

               Tuning properties in the awake animal were similar to those

              simultaneously recorded population responses in area V2. Using
              dimensionality reduction methods, we find that V1-V2 interactions
              occur through a communication subspace: V2 fluctuations are
              related to a small subset of V1 population activity patterns,
              distinct from the largest fluctuations shared among neurons
              within V1. In contrast, interactions between subpopulations
              within V1 are less selective. We propose that the communication
              subspace may be a general, population-level mechanism by which
              activity can be selectively routed across brain areas.",

              Statistical dependencies in the responses of sensory neurons

              multi-neuron spike responses4,5. The model, with parameters fit
              directly to physiological data, simultaneously captures both the
              stimulus dependence and detailed spatio-temporal correlations in
              population responses, and provides two insights into the
              structure of the neural code. First, neural encoding at the
              population level is less noisy than one would expect from the
              variability of individual neurons: spike times are more precise,
              and can be predicted more accurately when the spiking of
              neighbouring neurons is taken into account. Second, correlations
              provide additional sensory information: optimal, model-based
              decoding that exploits the response correlation structure
              extracts 20\% more information about the visual scene than
              decoding under the assumption of independence, and preserves 40\%
              more visual information than optimal linear decoding6. This
              model-based approach reveals the role of correlated activity in
              the retinal coding of visual stimuli, and provides a general
              framework for understanding the importance of correlated activity

               observed neural activity is informative of noisy
               yet-to-be-observed activity on single-trials, and may thus have

              driven by combinations of visual speed and run speed. As a
              population, V1 neurons predicted a linear combination of visual
              and run speed better than visual or run speeds alone. Successful
              navigation through the world requires accurate estimation of
              one's own speed. To derive this estimate, animals integrate
              visual speed gauged from optic flow and run speed gauged from
              proprioceptive and locomotor systems. The primary visual cortex
              (V1) carries signals related to visual speed, and its responses
              are also affected by run speed. To study how V1 combines these
              signals during navigation, we recorded from mice that traversed a
              virtual environment. Nearly half of the V1 neurons were reliably
              driven by combinations of visual speed and run speed. These
              neurons performed a weighted sum of the two speeds. The weights
              were diverse across neurons, and typically positive. As a
              population, V1 neurons predicted a linear combination of visual
              and run speeds better than either visual or run speeds alone.
              These data indicate that V1 in the mouse participates in a
              multimodal processing system that integrates visual motion and
              locomotion during navigation.",

              biomechanical degrees of freedom are coordinated to achieve a
              common goal. An especially puzzling aspect of coordination is
              that behavioral goals are achieved reliably and repeatedly with
              movements rarely reproducible in their detail. Existing
              theoretical frameworks emphasize either goal achievement or the
              richness of motor variability, but fail to reconcile the two.
              Here we propose an alternative theory based on stochastic optimal

              of uncertainty is to allow variability in redundant
              (task-irrelevant) dimensions. This strategy does not enforce a
              desired trajectory, but uses feedback more intelligently,
              correcting only those deviations that interfere with task goals.

               persist for tens to hundreds of trials before switching, and
               often switch multiple times within a session. The identified
               decision-making strategies were highly consistent across mice
               and comprised a single `engaged' state, in which decisions
               relied heavily on the sensory stimulus, and several biased
               states in which errors frequently occurred. These results
               provide a powerful alternate explanation for `lapses' often
               observed in rodent behavioral experiments, and suggest that
               standard measures of performance mask the presence of major
               changes in strategy across trials. The authors implement
               model-based analyses to uncover strategies used by mice and
               humans during sensory decision-making. Contrary to common
               wisdom, mice do not lapse and, instead, switch between sustained
               engaged and disengaged states.",

              interrupted by backward masking. Second, invasive physiological
              responses along the human ventral cortex exhibited visually
              selective responses to partially visible objects that were
              delayed compared with whole objects, suggesting the need for

              interact with moving objects. Understanding how locomotion
              influences optic flow processing and perception is therefore
              essential to understand how animals successfully interact with
              their environment. Here, we review research investigating how
              perception and neural encoding of optic flow are altered during
              self-motion, focusing on locomotion. Self-motion has been found
              to influence estimation and sensitivity for optic flow speed and
              direction. Nonvisual self-motion signals also increase
              compensation for self-driven optic flow when parsing the visual
              motion of moving objects. The integration of visual and nonvisual
              self-motion signals largely follows principles of Bayesian

              self-motion perception. The calibration of visual and nonvisual

              neural networks can learn highly nonlinear functions for visual
              information processing. Two approaches based on deep learning
              have recently been successfully applied to neural data: transfer
              learning for predicting neural activity in higher areas of the
              primate ventral stream and data-driven models to predict retina
              and V1 neural activity of mice. However, so far there exists no
              comparison between the two approaches and neither of them has

              the ability of both approaches to predict neural responses to

              CNNs set the new state of the art for predicting neural responses

                consist of a convolutional network (core) shared across all
                neurons which learns a representation of neural computation in
                visual cortex and a neuron-specific readout that linearly
                combines the relevant features in this representation. The goal
                of this paper is to test whether such a representation is
                indeed generally characteristic for visual cortex, i.e.
                generalizes between animals of a species, and what factors
                contribute to obtaining such a generalizing core. To push all
                non-linear computations into the core where the generalizing
                cortical features should be learned, we devise a novel readout
                that reduces the number of parameters per neuron in the readout
                by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the previous
                state-of-the-art. It does so by taking advantage of retinotopy
                and learns a Gaussian distribution over the neuron's receptive
                field position. With this new readout we train our network on
                neural responses from mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and
                obtain a gain in performance of 7\% compared to the previous
                state-of-the-art network. We then investigate whether the
                convolutional core indeed captures general cortical features by
                using the core in transfer learning to a different animal. When
                transferring a core trained on thousands of neurons from
                various animals and scans we exceed the performance of training
                directly on that animal by 12\%, and outperform a commonly used
                VGG16 core pre-trained on imagenet by 33\%. In addition,
                transfer learning with our data-driven core is more
                data-efficient than direct training, achieving the same
                performance with only 40\% of the data. Our model with its

              and locomotion is known to modulate neural responses in the mouse
              visual system. This modulation is hypothesised to improve the
              processing of behaviourally relevant visual inputs, which may
              change rapidly during locomotion. However, little is known about
              how locomotion modulates the temporal dynamics (time courses) of
              visually-evoked neural responses. Here, we analysed the temporal
              dynamics of single neuron and population responses to dot field
              stimuli moving at a range of visual speeds using the Visual
              Coding dataset from the Allen Institute for Brain Science[1][1].
              Single neuron responses had diverse temporal dynamics that varied
              between stationary and running sessions. Increased dynamic range
              and more reliable responses in running sessions enabled faster,
              stronger and more persistent encoding of visual speed. Population
              activity reflected the temporal dynamics of single neuron
              responses, including their modulation by locomotor state - neural
              trajectories of population activity made more direct transitions
              between baseline and stimulus steady states in running sessions.
              The structure of population coding also changed with locomotor
              state -- population activity prioritised the encoding of visual
              speed in running, but not stationary sessions. Our results reveal
              a profound influence of locomotion on the temporal dynamics of
              neural responses. We demonstrate that during locomotion, mouse
              visual areas prioritise the encoding of potentially
              fast-changing, behaviourally relevant visual features. \#\#\#

              mouse visual system because mouse visual cortex has both lower
              retinal resolution and a shallower hierarchy than the primate.
              Moreover, the category supervision deep networks typically
              receive is neither ethologically relevant to the mouse in
              semantic content, nor realistic in quantity. As a result,
              standard supervised deep neural networks have proven
              quantitatively ineffective at modeling mouse visual data. Here,
              we develop and evaluate models that remedy these structural and
              functional gaps. We first demonstrate that shallow hierarchical
              architectures applied to lower resolution images improve match to
              neural responses, both in electro-physiological and calcium
              imaging data. We then show that networks trained using
              contrastive embedding methods, a recent unsupervised learning
              objective that requires no semantic labeling, achieve neural
              prediction performance that substantially exceed that of the same
              architectures trained in a supervised manner, across a wide

              shallow unsupervised models transfer to a wide variety of
              non-categorical visual tasks better than categorization-trained
              models. Taken together, our results suggest that mouse visual
              cortex is a low-resolution, shallow network that makes best use
              of the mouse's limited resources to create a light-weight,

              mechanisms used by the mouse to represent the visual world remain
              unclear. In the primate, researchers have argued from both
              behavioral and neural evidence that a key step in visual
              representation is ``figure-ground segmentation,'' the delineation
              of figures as distinct from backgrounds [[1][1]--[4][2]]. To
              determine if mice also show behavioral and neural signatures of
              figure-ground segmentation, we trained mice on a figure-ground
              segmentation task where figures were defined by gratings and
              naturalistic textures moving counterphase to the background.
              Unlike primates, mice were severely limited in their ability to
              segment figure from ground using the opponent motion cue, with
              segmentation behavior strongly dependent on the specific carrier
              pattern. Remarkably, when mice were forced to localize
              naturalistic patterns defined by opponent motion, they adopted a
              strategy of brute force memorization of texture patterns. In
              contrast, primates, including humans, macaques, and mouse lemurs,
              could readily segment figures independent of carrier pattern
              using the opponent motion cue. Consistent with mouse behavior,
              neural responses to the same stimuli recorded in mouse visual
              areas V1, RL, and LM also did not support texture-invariant
              segmentation of figures using opponent motion. Modeling revealed
              that the texture dependence of both the mouse's behavior and
              neural responses could be explained by a feedforward neural
              network lacking explicit segmentation capabilities. These
              findings reveal a fundamental limitation in the ability of mice
              to segment visual objects compared to primates. \#\#\# Competing

               only the final layer's weights on a network otherwise trained on

              important first step in the analysis of a visual scene.
              Figure-ground segregation is thought to rely on interactions
              between the primary visual cortex (area V1) and higher visual
              areas. Upon presentation of a new image, the initial V1 responses
              reflect the information in the neurons9 receptive fields (RFs),
              whereas later activity is context-dependent so that the
              representations of figures are enhanced relative to the
              background1-3. It is unknown if the figural response enhancement
              in V1 plays a role in perception and the mechanisms that produce
              it are not well understood. We trained mice to report a
              contrast-defined figure or a figure on a textured background that
              required figure-ground segregation, and optogenetically silenced
              V1 activity at different time-points. Suppression of early V1
              activity interfered with both visual tasks, but suppression of
              the later activity selectively interfered with figure-ground
              perception. Using widefield imaging, we observed that figures
              also elicited stronger activity than the background in higher
              visual areas, and we used optogenetics to demonstrate that the
              extra activity is fed back to enhance the V1 figure
              representation. Within V1, figures increased the activity of
              pyramidal cells, parvalbumin (PV) and vasoactive intestinal
              peptide (VIP) positive interneurons but they decreased the
              activity of somatostatin-positive (SOM) interneurons. These
              results support the view that VIP interneurons inhibit
              SOM-interneurons to disinhibit the cortical column4. Our results
              demonstrate that figure-ground modulation of V1 neurons
              contributes to perception. We expect that the observed
              interactions between lower and higher brain regions generalize to
              other sensory modalities and that they will inform
              neurobiologically realistic models of scene perception.One

              perception remains incomplete. Microstimulation and optogenetic
              experiments have shown that manipulating cortical activity can
              influence sensory-guided behaviour or elicit artificial percepts.
              And yet, some perceptual tasks can still be solved when sensory
              cortex is silenced or removed, suggesting that cortical activity
              may not always be essential. Reconciling these findings, and
              providing a quantitative framework linking cortical activity and
              behaviour, requires knowledge of the identity of the cells being
              activated during the behaviour, the engagement of the local and
              downstream networks, and the cortical and behavioural state.
              Here, we performed two-photon population calcium imaging in L2/3
              primary visual cortex (V1) of headfixed mice performing a visual
              detection task while simultaneously activating specific groups of
              neurons using targeted two-photon optogenetics during low
              contrast visual stimulation. Only activation of groups of cells
              with similar tuning to the relevant visual stimulus led to a
              measurable bias of detection behaviour. Targeted photostimulation
              revealed signatures of centre-surround, predominantly inhibitory
              and like-to-like connectivity motifs in the local network which
              shaped the visual stimulus representation and partially explained
              the change in stimulus detectability. Moreover, the behavioural
              effects depended on overall performance: when the task was
              challenging for the mouse, V1 activity was more closely linked to
              performance, and cortical stimulation boosted perception. In
              contrast, when the task was easy, V1 activity was less
              informative about performance and cortical stimulation suppressed
              stimulus detection. Altogether, we find that both the selective
              routing of information through functionally specific circuits,
              and the prevailing cortical state, make similarly large
              contributions to explaining the behavioural response to
              photostimulation. Our results thus help to reconcile
              contradictory findings about the involvement of primary sensory
              cortex in behavioural tasks, suggesting that the influence of
              cortical activity on behaviour is dynamically reassigned
              depending on the demands of the task.",

  abstract = "The brain has evolved to transform sensory information in the
              environment into neural representations that can be used for
              perception and action. Higher-order sensory cortical areas, with
              their increasingly complex receptive fields and integrative
              properties, are thought to be critical nodes for this function.
              This is especially true in the primate visual cortex, in which
              functionally specialized areas are engaged in parallel streams to
              support diverse computations. Recent anatomical and physiological
              studies of the mouse visual cortex have revealed a similarly
              complex network of specialized higher-order areas. This structure
              provides a useful model for determining the synaptic and circuit
              mechanisms through which information is transformed across
              distinct processing stages. In this review, we summarize the
              current knowledge on the layout, connectivity, and functional
              properties of the higher visual areas in the mouse. In addition,
              we speculate on the contribution of these areas to perception and
              action, and how knowledge of the mouse visual system can inform

              responses can be understood as the result of a cooperation of
              motor and visual areas to jointly explain optic flow. This
              cooperation requires that optic flow is not explained redundantly
              by both areas, meaning that optic flow inputs to V1 that are
              predictable from motor neurons should be canceled (i.e.,
              explained away). As a result, neurons in V1 represent only
              external causes of optic flow, which could allow the animal to
              easily detect movements that are independent of its own
              locomotion. We implement the proposed model in a spiking neural
              network, where coding errors are computed in dendrites and
              synaptic weights are learned with voltage-dependent plasticity

               the architectural design needs to account for data limitations:
               While new experimental techniques enable recordings from

              This remarkable performance is mediated by the representation
              formed in inferior temporal (IT) cortex. In parallel, recent
              advances in machine learning have led to ever higher performing

              accurately produce such a comparison, a major difficulty has been
              a unifying metric that accounts for experimental limitations,
              such as the amount of noise, the number of neural recording

              representational complexity. Our evaluations show that, unlike

              well on measures of representational similarity to IT, and on
              measures of predicting individual IT multi-unit responses.
              Whether these DNNs rely on computational mechanisms similar to
              the primate visual system is yet to be determined, but, unlike

               On some trials the animals were instructed to pay attention to
               those stimuli, and on other trials they were instructed to pay
               attention to other stimuli outside the receptive field. In this

              the reality that natural behavior is rarely discrete, brain
              activity follows multiple time courses that do not necessarily

  abstract = "Neurons in the visual system integrate over a wide range of
              spatial scales. This diversity is thought to enable both local
              and global computations. To understand how spatial information is
              encoded across the mouse visual system, we use two-photon imaging
              to measure receptive fields (RFs) and size-tuning in primary
              visual cortex (V1) and three downstream higher visual areas
              (HVAs: LM (lateromedial), AL (anterolateral), and PM
              (posteromedial)) in mice of both sexes. Neurons in PM, compared
              with V1 or the other HVAs, have significantly larger RF sizes and
              less surround suppression, independent of stimulus eccentricity
              or contrast. To understand how this specialization of RFs arises
              in the HVAs, we measured the spatial properties of V1 inputs to
              each area. Spatial integration of V1 axons was remarkably similar
              across areas and significantly different from the tuning of
              neurons in their target HVAs. Thus, unlike other visual features
              studied in this system, specialization of spatial integration in
              PM cannot be explained by specific projections from V1 to the
              HVAs. Further, the differences in RF properties could not be
              explained by differences in convergence of V1 inputs to the HVAs.
              Instead, our data suggest that distinct inputs from other areas
              or connectivity within PM may support the area's unique ability
              to encode global features of the visual scene, whereas V1, LM,
              and AL may be more specialized for processing local
              features.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Surround suppression is a common
              feature of visual processing whereby large stimuli are less
              effective at driving neuronal responses than smaller stimuli.
              This is thought to enhance efficiency in the population code and
              enable higher-order processing of visual information, such as
              figure-ground segregation. However, this comes at the expense of
              global computations. Here we find that surround suppression is
              not equally represented across mouse visual areas: primary visual
              cortex has substantially more surround suppression than higher
              visual areas, and one higher area has significantly less
              suppression than two others examined, suggesting that these areas
              have distinct functional roles. Thus, we have identified a novel

  author   = "Dadarlat, Maria C and Stryker, Michael P",
  abstract = "Neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) are selective for
              particular properties of visual stimuli. Locomotion causes a
              change in cortical state that leaves their selectivity unchanged
              but strengthens their responses. Both locomotion and the change
              in cortical state are thought to be initiated by projections from
              the mesencephalic locomotor region, the latter through a
              disinhibitory circuit in V1. By recording simultaneously from a
              large number of single neurons in alert mice viewing moving
              gratings, we investigated the relationship between locomotion and
              the information contained within the neural population. We found
              that locomotion improved encoding of visual stimuli in V1 by two
              mechanisms. First, locomotion-induced increases in firing rates
              enhanced the mutual information between visual stimuli and single
              neuron responses over a fixed window of time. Second, stimulus
              discriminability was improved, even for fixed population firing
              rates, because of a decrease in noise correlations across the
              population. These two mechanisms contributed differently to
              improvements in discriminability across cortical layers, with
              changes in firing rates most important in the upper layers and
              changes in noise correlations most important in layer V.
              Together, these changes resulted in a threefold to fivefold
              reduction in the time needed to precisely encode grating
              direction and orientation. These results support the hypothesis
              that cortical state shifts during locomotion to accommodate an
              increased load on the visual system when mice are
              moving.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This paper contains three novel
              findings about the representation of information in neurons
              within the primary visual cortex of the mouse. First, we show
              that locomotion reduces by at least a factor of 3 the time needed
              for information to accumulate in the visual cortex that allows
              the distinction of different visual stimuli. Second, we show that
              the effect of locomotion is to increase information in cells of
              all layers of the visual cortex. Third, we show that the means by
              which information is enhanced by locomotion differs between the
              upper layers, where the major effect is the increasing of firing
              rates, and in layer V, where the major effect is the reduction in
              noise correlations.",

              set of self-similar, spatially shifted linear filters. In macaque
              primary visual cortex (V1), simple cell responses can be captured
              with a single filter, whereas complex cells combine a set of
              filters, creating position invariance. These filters cannot be
              estimated using standard methods, such as spike-triggered
              averaging. Subspace methods like spike-triggered covariance can
              recover multiple filters but require substantial amounts of data,
              and recover an orthogonal basis for the subspace in which the
              filters reside, rather than the filters themselves. Here, we
              assume a linear-nonlinear-linear-nonlinear (LN-LN) cascade model
              in which the first LN stage consists of shifted
              (``convolutional'') copies of a single filter, followed by a

              processing and transmission of sensory signals. Here, we studied
              the cortical representation of the retinal image in mice that
              spontaneously switched between a state of rest and a constricted
              pupil, and one of active locomotion and a dilated pupil,
              indicative of heightened attention. We measured the selectivity
              of neurons in primary visual cortex for orientation and spatial
              frequency, as well as their response gain, in these two
              behavioral states. Consistent with prior studies, we found that
              preferred orientation and spatial frequency remained invariant
              across states, whereas response gain increased during locomotion
              relative to rest. Surprisingly, relative gain, defined as the
              ratio between the gain during locomotion and the gain during
              rest, was not uniform across the population. Cells tuned to high
              spatial frequencies showed larger relative gain compared with
              those tuned to lower spatial frequencies. The preferential
              enhancement of high-spatial-frequency information was also
              reflected in our ability to decode the stimulus from population
              activity. Finally, we show that changes in gain originate from
              shifts in the operating point of neurons along a spiking
              nonlinearity as a function of behavioral state. Differences in
              the relative gain experienced by neurons with high and low
              spatial frequencies are due to corresponding differences in how
              these cells shift their operating points between behavioral
              states. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT How behavioral state modulates the
              processing and transmission of sensory signals remains poorly
              understood. Here, we show that the mean firing rate and neuronal
              gain increase during locomotion as a result in a shift of the
              operating point of neurons. We define relative gain as the ratio
              between the gain of neurons during locomotion and rest.
              Interestingly, relative gain is higher in cells with preferences
              for higher spatial frequencies than those with
              low-spatial-frequency selectivity. This means that, during a
              state of locomotion and heightened attention, the population
              activity in primary visual cortex can support better spatial

              are more accurate than any other model in classifying images
              taken from various datasets, (2) DNNs do the best job in
              predicting the pattern of human errors in classifying objects
              taken from various behavioral benchmark datasets, and (3) DNNs do
              the best job in predicting brain signals in response to images
              taken from various brain benchmark datasets (e.g., single cell
              responses or fMRI data). However, most behavioral and brain
              benchmarks report the outcomes of observational experiments that
              do not manipulate any independent variables, and we show that the
              good prediction on these datasets may be mediated by DNNs that
              share little overlap with biological vision. More
              problematically, we show that DNNs account for almost no results
              from psychological research. This contradicts the common claim
              that DNNs are good, let alone the best, models of human object
              recognition. We argue that theorists interested in developing
              biologically plausible models of human vision need to direct
              their attention to explaining psychological findings. More
              generally, theorists need to build models that explain the
              results of experiments that manipulate independent variables
              designed to test hypotheses rather than compete on predicting
              observational data. We conclude by briefly summarizing various
              promising modelling approaches that focus on psychological data.",

              modulations during experiments with brain-machine interfaces",
  author   = "Benyamini, Miri and Zacksenhouse, Miriam",
  abstract = "Recent experiments with brain-machine-interfaces (BMIs) indicate
              that the extent of neural modulations increased abruptly upon
              starting to operate the interface, and especially after the
              monkey stopped moving its hand. In contrast, neural modulations
              that are correlated with the kinematics of the movement remained
              relatively unchanged. Here we demonstrate that similar changes
              are produced by simulated neurons that encode the relevant
              signals generated by an optimal feedback controller during
              simulated BMI experiments. The optimal feedback controller relies
              on state estimation that integrates both visual and
              proprioceptive feedback with prior estimations from an internal
              model. The processing required for optimal state estimation and
              control were conducted in the state-space, and neural recording
              was simulated by modeling two populations of neurons that encode
              either only the estimated state or also the control signal. Spike
              counts were generated as realizations of doubly stochastic
              Poisson processes with linear tuning curves. The model
              successfully reconstructs the main features of the kinematics and
              neural activity during regular reaching movements. Most
              importantly, the activity of the simulated neurons successfully
              reproduces the observed changes in neural modulations upon
              switching to brain control. Further theoretical analysis and
              simulations indicate that increasing the process noise during
              normal reaching movement results in similar changes in neural
              modulations. Thus, we conclude that the observed changes in
              neural modulations during BMI experiments can be attributed to
              increasing process noise associated with the imperfect BMI
              filter, and, more directly, to the resulting increase in the
              variance of the encoded signals associated with state estimation
              and the required control signal.",

              science, and neuroscience where they have been used to quantify
              behavior and its neural correlates for a vast range of mental
              phenomena. Their power derives from the combination of controlled
              experiments and rigorous analysis through signal detection
              theory. Unfortunately, they require many tedious trials and
              preferably highly trained participants. A recently developed
              approach, continuous psychophysics, promises to transform the
              field by abandoning the rigid trial structure involving binary
              responses and replacing it with continuous behavioral adjustments
              to dynamic stimuli. However, what has precluded wide adoption of
              this approach is that current analysis methods do not account for
              the additional variability introduced by the motor component of
              the task and therefore recover perceptual thresholds that are

              This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of

              start toward understanding the properties of nonlinear visual
              neurons, we have recorded responses of striate complex cells to
              hundreds of images, including both simple stimuli (bars and
              sinusoids) as well as complex stimuli (random textures and 3-D
              shaded surfaces). The latter set tended to give the strongest
              response. We created a neural network model for each neuron using
              an iterative optimization algorithm. The recorded responses to
              some stimulus patterns (the training set) were used to create the
              model, while responses to other patterns were reserved for
              testing the networks. The networks predicted recorded responses
              to training set patterns with a median correlation of 0.95. They
              were able to predict responses to test stimuli not in the
              training set with a correlation of 0.78 overall, and a
              correlation of 0.65 for complex stimuli considered alone. Thus,
              they were able to capture much of the input/output transfer
              function of the neurons, even for complex patterns. Examining
              connection strengths within each network, different parts of the
              network appeared to handle information at different spatial
              scales. To gain further insights, the network models were
              inverted to construct ``optimal'' stimuli for each cell, and
              their receptive fields were mapped with high-resolution spots.
              The receptive field properties of complex cells could not be
              reduced to any simpler mathematical formulation than the network
              models themselves.",

              processing, and a major effort in systems neuroscience is devoted
              to understanding how it encodes information about visual stimuli.
              Within V1, many neurons respond selectively to edges of a given
              preferred orientation: these are known as simple or complex
              cells, and they are well-studied. Other neurons respond to
              localized center-surround image features. Still others respond
              selectively to certain image stimuli, but the specific features
              that excite them are unknown. Moreover, even for the simple and
              complex cells-- the best-understood V1 neurons-- it is
              challenging to predict how they will respond to natural image
              stimuli. Thus, there are important gaps in our understanding of
              how V1 encodes images. To fill this gap, we train deep
              convolutional neural networks to predict the firing rates of V1
              neurons in response to natural image stimuli, and find that 15\%
              of these neurons are within 10\% of their theoretical limit of

              predictor network to identify the image features (receptive
              fields) that cause the V1 neurons to spike. In addition to those
              with previously-characterized receptive fields (Gabor wavelet and

  abstract = "The association between motor activity and dishabituation
              suggests that the latter derives either from motor system
              collaterals or from mechanoreceptive reafference, and the
              probable anatomical and physiological bases for modulation of
              DCMD responsiveness are discussed. 1. Recorded from a dissected
              immobilized animal, or from an unrestrained animal which is
              quiescent, the descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD)
              neurone shows an exponential decremental response to a repetitive
              stimulus (habituation), reaching a plateau level characteristic
              of the stimulus conditions. The process is site-specific on the
              retina, and movement to a new area of retina gives a complete
              recovery. In the absence of stimulation responsiveness returns
              over minutes or hours. 2. Immediate recovery without a rest
              (dishabituation) can be obtained by a variety of strong sensory
              stimuli of several different modalities (`extra-stimuli') or by
              non specific electrical stimulation of parts of the CNS. The
              dishabituating efficacy of all these wanes with repetition. When
              the habituating stimulus is moved to a new retinal site the
              previous site is not dishabituated. 3. Dishabituation is not
              site-specific but affects the whole retina simultaneously. It
              appears to reverse the original decremental process (`re-set')
              rather than to produce an independent enhancement elsewhere in
              the pathway, as it does not increase the response from a
              submaximally stimulated, but unhabituated, retinal site. 4. In
              unrestrained animals dishabituating extra-stimuli also cause
              behavioural arousal or other motor activity. When motor activity
              starts, the DCMD is dishabituated and shows no regular
              decremental trend thereafter until movement ceases. DCMD
              background activity is also increased. These effects are not due
              to the visual stimulus of the moving appendages. 5. The
              association between motor activity and dishabituation suggests
              that the latter derives either from motor system collaterals or
              from mechanoreceptive reafference. Stimulation of the antennal
              nerve of a totally de-efferented brain cause some dishabituation;
              this eliminates the lower motor system (below command-fibre
              level) as the source of dishabituation and suggests it is purely
              sensory. 6. The activity of a thoracic cord unit (of possibly a
              wide-field mechanoreceptor interneurone) precedes by 5-20 sec,
              and closely correlates with, changes in responsiveness of the
              DCMD. It is either an important input to, or an output from, the
              dishabituating system. 7. Progressive reduction of sensory input
              to the brain affects DCMD responsiveness as follows: (i)
              spontaneous dishabituation is less frequent, (ii) dishabituation
              is less easily induced and smaller, (iii) rate of habituation is
              increased, (iv) plateau response level after habituation is
              lower. 8. Electrical stimulation of the circumoesophageal
              connective can depress DCMD responsiveness for many minutes. 9.

              DCMD responsiveness are discussed.",

               predicting neural population responses. Most of these models
               currently focus on predicting the mean response of each neuron
               for a given input. However, neural variability around this mean
               is not just noise and plays a central role in several theories
               on neural computation. To capture this variability, we need
               models that predict full response distributions for a given
               stimulus. However, to measure the quality of such models,
               commonly used correlation-based metrics are not sufficient as
               they mainly care about the mean of the response distribution. An
               interpretable alternative evaluation metric for likelihood-based
               models is \textbackslashtextit\{Information Gain\} (IG) which
               evaluates the likelihood of a model relative to a lower and
               upper bound. However, while a lower bound is usually easy to
               obtain, constructing an upper bound turns out to be challenging
               for neural recordings with relatively low numbers of repeated
               trials, high (shared) variability, and sparse responses. In this
               work, we generalize the jack-knife oracle estimator for the
               mean---commonly used for correlation metrics---to a flexible
               Bayesian oracle estimator for IG based on posterior predictive
               distributions. We describe and address the challenges that arise
               when estimating the lower and upper bounds from small datasets.
               We then show that our upper bound estimate is data-efficient and
               robust even in the case of sparse responses and low
               signal-to-noise ratio. We further provide the derivation of the
               upper bound estimator for a variety of common distributions
               including the state-of-the-art zero-inflated mixture models, and
               relate IG to common mean-based metrics. Finally, we use our
               approach to evaluate such a mixture model resulting in $90\%$ IG
               performance.",
